{"name":"Swc-stanford-may13","body":"**When**: May 6-7, 2013, 9.00 am to 5.00 pm.\r\n\r\n**Where**: Room B005, The Li Ka Shing Center for Learning and Knowledge (LKSC).\r\n\r\n**What**: Our goal is to help scientists and engineers become more productive by teaching them basic computing skills, like program design, version control, testing, and task automation. In our teaching we emphasise how these skills can contribute to quality, usable, reproducible research. In this two-day boot camp, short tutorials will alternate with hands-on practical exercises. Attendees will be encouraged both to help one another, and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems during and between sessions. \r\n\r\n**Who**: The course is aimed at postgraduate students and other scientists who are familiar with basic programming concepts (like loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions) but need help to translate this knowledge into practical tools to help them work more productively.\r\n\r\n**Requirements**: Attendees must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed. (The list will be sent to attendees a week before the boot camp.)\r\n\r\n**Content**: The syllabus for this boot camp will include:\r\n* Using the shell to do more in less time.\r\n* Using version control to manage and share information.\r\n* Basic Python programming.\r\n* How (and how much) to test programs.\r\n* Working with relational databases.\r\n\r\n**Registration*: Eventbrite TBD","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
